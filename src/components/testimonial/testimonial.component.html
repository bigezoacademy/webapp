          It is a great feeling when I can imagine a design and at the same time
          able to bring it to a reality!. I liked the fact that Tutor Alfred
          taught us from first principles and in a "tell, show, do, apply"
          manner.

          The opportunity to learn graphic designing was a beautiful way to
          start my year. Am always excited about creating something new,
          something I thought was hard, now am able to do. The class has as well
          challenged my way of life. Am now more committed and diligent to
          tasks. Also as a medic am glad that I won't have to look at patients
          all the time.

          The graphics design course is one of my answered prayers in 2024 , for
          long I have been struggling to create flyers and edit photos using my
          phone apps that turns to be so hectic and poor quality. The course has
          been so smooth because teacher Alfred delivered the content in the
          simplest way possible to understand and grasp.
